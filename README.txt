This directory contains both the source code and the compiled byte code of GiveawayApp. When the NamePicker.jar is executed, it prompts the user for the file path of a CSV with a specific format (see Giveaway Names.csv). From this file, the program (after running some data validation on the file path and the file contents) will pick a random name. The chances of any given name being chosen is weighted by how many entries it had (e.g. @someuser has 40 entries. 40 entries in 400 totals entries means a 10% chance of winning).
